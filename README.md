This service contains basic CRUD functionality for it's models. More complex methods can be created as needed to meet client-side requirements after this microservice environment is hosted, and communication with a client-side application is established. 

Currently, there is no inter-service communication with other services in this microservice environment. REST-Template, fallback, and circuit break implementations will need to be added in future sprints.
